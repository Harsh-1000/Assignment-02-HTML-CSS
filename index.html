            <p>Anime is a Japanese animation style that is produced or influenced by it. It is the Japanese term for cartoon or animation where the Japanese use the word to describe all cartoons irrespective of the nation. However, outside Japan, anime denotes animation movies that come exclusively from Japan, distinguished by blazing graphics, energetic characters, and attractive themes such as sci-fi, romance, and supernatural forces. <span style="font-weight: bold; color: red;"> Therefore, consider this syllogism: all anime shows are cartoons, but not all cartoons are anime.</span>

            <h2><hr>More About Anime</h2>
            <p class="more-info">Anime is a unique storytelling medium that transcends cultural boundaries, appealing to audiences worldwide with its compelling narratives and intricate world-building. Unlike many Western cartoons, anime often tackles complex themes, including morality, existentialism, and societal issues, making it accessible to both children and adults. Series like <span style="color: red;">Naruto and One Piece</span> explore themes of friendship and perseverance, while shows such as Attack on Titan and Death Note delve into darker, more thought-provoking territory.</p>
            <p class="more-info">
                The mediumâ€™s versatility is further reflected in its artistic diversity, ranging from the hyper-realistic visuals of Your Name to the minimalist, atmospheric approach of <span style="color: red;">Studio Ghibli films</span>. Anime is also celebrated for its ability to evoke strong emotions, often combining beautiful music scores with powerful storytelling moments. Its influence extends beyond entertainment, shaping fashion, art, and even international pop culture, as seen in cosplay events and fan communities. Whether through epic adventures, heartwarming slice-of-life stories, or groundbreaking experimental works, anime continues to captivate and inspire millions globally.
